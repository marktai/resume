% \section{Recommendations}

% \begin{tabular}{r|p{15cm}}    
%  \textsc{Sept 15} & \textbf{Tai Mai, Software Engineer at Ooyala} â€“ Advised Mark at Ooyala\\ 
%  \textsc{2015} & Mark has been a valuable member of our small team. Eager to learn and able to master new technologies quickly, Mark has been instrumental in developing an internal website to monitor our companyâ€™s application deployment system. This website is crucial in helping customers keep track of the health of their deployed applications. Mark has the amazing ability to come up to speed very quickly with little guidance and was able to finish all his tasks during his time as an intern here at Ooyala. Mark would be a valuable asset to any company and I highly recommend him. \\
%  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 
%  \textsc{Sept 2} & \textbf{Shushma Thoutam, Mobile QALead Hightail} - Managed Mark indirectly at Hightail\\ 
%  \textsc{2013} & Mark is exceptionally gifted. Mark joined the HT team as a summer intern for developing automation scripts for the Mobile apps. He did an awesome job in developing the automation suite for HT iOS app that can run on different versions of iPhone and iPAD. He taught himself the tools and scripting languages he needed to be successful at this task. He has good problem solving skills which helped him to resolve some of the automation challenges. \\ \\
%  & Mark is an innovative thinker, and a pleasure to be around. I highly recommend Mark for any place where he can dive right in and be expected to produce great results in short order. \\
%  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

%  \textsc{Aug 22} & \textbf{Anand Taralika, Engineering Manager at EMC} - Managed Mark at Hightail\\ 
%  \textsc{2013} & I hired Mark to help with test automation for Hightail's mobile products. Given a set of test cases and an automation tool, Mark was tasked with writing an automated test for each test case for the iPad and iPhone versions of the Hightail app. He came up to speed with the tool very quickly and was able to automate the tests with much less support and much faster than I anticipated. He even came up with a way so that all automated tests he wrote were device agnostic, and would run on both the iPhone and iPad. Mark has a logical bent of mind and will be very productive in the field of software engineering. I'd not hesitate in hiring him again. \\
%  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

%  \textsc{Aug 15} & \textbf{Christina Samuel, QA Engineer at Apple} - Worked directly with Mark at Hightail\\ 
%  \textsc{2013} & I am happy to write this recommendation for Mark Tai! I had the opportunity to work with him recently and found him to be a motivated and enthusiastic engineer. He is a creative problem solver, who is cheerful and dependable as a fellow team member. He is focused and efficient at completing projects/tasks with minimal supervision, well ahead of schedule. I have every confidence in Mark, that he will be a valuable asset to any team, he works with. \\
%  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 
%  \textsc{Feb 1} & \textbf{Sharon Fox, Clinical Research Liner Manager} (Letter of recommendation)\\ 
%  \textsc{2013} & Mark has been a math tutor to my twin daughterâ€™s Sophia and Savannah for the past three and a half years. He has tutored them in Pre-algebra, Algebra 1 and Geometry. Even though the girls are twins, they have completely different learning styles. Mark has had to determine what is the best technique in teaching them. Mark himself is brilliant in math but knowing math and teaching math are completely different skills. He has mastered them both. Mark also has an incredible amount of patience and is good at keeping the girls focused on their lesson. He has also been extremely helpful in giving them helpful tips on how to prepare and study for tests and answered many questions about high school in general. \\ \\
%  & Mark is reliable and very hard working. He has excellent communication skills when it comes to providing feedback after each lesson he teaches the girls. It is invaluable as a parent to have someone that you can depend on when it comes to teaching your child math and preparing them for tests.\\ \\
%  & Mark has my highest recommendation and I am happy to furnish more details if you would like additional information. \\
%  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 
%  \textsc{Sept 12} & \textbf{Erik Burns, Head of chameleonmath.com} â€“ Managed Mark at chameleonmath.com\\ 
%  \textsc{2012} & Mark worked as a CS programming summer intern for our math education startup. While a mere Sophomore in high school, he taught himself Python from scratch, and ended up writing a large volume of clean, modular, high-quality math code. And he did it fast! He even discovered and fixed an obscure Python bug that our senior engineers could not resolve. \\ \\
%  & Mark is self-running, creative, and highly dedicated; all traits that make him a great asset to technology projects. I recommend him very highly. \\
